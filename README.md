This is one of those programs that I would hesitate to show to my computer science professor.

It is much worse than simply a program devoid of comments. There are random numbers floating around in the code, variables with indecipherable names, pointers seemingly just for the sake of having pointers, and functions I have no memory of writing. It looks like an obfuscated code submission. I’m not sure if I was in a rotten mood when I wrote it or what. Yet somehow, it does the job. All of the seemingly meaningless parts coalesce into a working program.

It occurs to me now that I have not said anything about the program itself yet, so you have no idea what I’m talking about. I guess I will get to explaining that bit now.

Well…it’s a riddle program. Run it, and you get a riddle. A new one every week. I would like to say that the program generates the riddle itself–or rather, I would like to say that and have it be true. But alas, it is much easier to train a program to plagiarize than to create. What a cruel world this is.

You can tell that the program steals the riddle because if you go to the puzzler page on cartalk.com, you will see the exact same riddle. Of course, from your point of view it’s possible that Cartalk always steals the riddle from my program, but Occam’s razor would suggest that if you think that, you’re not too bright.
